# Secure-User-Management-Dashboard

A small user login signup authentication react app using middleware.
I use tailwind Css to complete this project.cd
All the files are stored in user-dashboard.
I broke down the entire page into small, reusable components to ensure that my code is readable and maintainable and doesn't have bloated HTML templates.
I succesfully installed tailwind css and configured the directory.
directory structure of my projet is as follow:
.
├── components/
│ ├── FormAction.js : Submit buttton action
│ ├── FormExtra.js :holds the template and styles for a simple "Remember me" functionality.
│ ├── Header.js
│ ├── Input.js
│ ├── Login.js : where the entire Login form will be rendered.
│ └── Signup.js
├── constants/
│ └── formFields.js
└── pages/
├── Login.js
└── Signup.js
